        hey! i am ishant.
        <br><br>
        i love reading books, writing stuff, meeting new people and cricket.
        <br><br>
        <a href="https://ishantjuyal.notion.site/1b758a6d9cae4cfa81cd03cf21d73f6e?v=169873d56e8f49f9be11e5f779564199" target="_blank">this</a> is 
        a list of all the books i am currently reading, or have read this year.
        <br><br>
        i write my thoughts and share them as a newsletter <a href="https://ishant.substack.com" target="_blank">here</a>. try it out!
        <br><br>
        sometimes (like once a year) i code, but i usually spend my time thinking about product ideas and not enough building them.
        <br><br>
        in the past, i have been the founder of <a href="https://crework.in" target="_blank">crework</a>
        where we built a community for people to build better projects and meet the best peer group.
        over a period of 18 months, we organized several cohorts and taught 100+ students.
        <br><br>
        currently, i am working (or pretending to work) as an APM.
